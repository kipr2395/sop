		<p>Dear Bash,</p>

		<p>Thank you for bringing out the best in me. I'm especially grateful for how legit you make me look when I'm working through my terminal. To express my appreciation for how much easier you make my life, I'm going to list my favorite qualities about you.	
		</p>

		<div class="buttons">
		<button class="one">Click Here</button>
		</div> 
	
		<ul class="firstlist">
			<li>I love that you always tell me where I am whenever I type <strong>pwd</strong></li>
			<li>And when I type <strong>ls</strong>, you even tell me everything in the directory I'm in. It's so convenient!</li>
			<li>When I want to change directories, all I have to say is <strong>cd directoryname</strong></li>
			<li>If I want to go back a directory, I just have to say <strong>cd ..</strong></li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<p>But these are just a few of the things that make you special. Your personality really shines when I need to create and edit directories and files.</p>
	
		<div class="buttons">
		<button class="two">Click Here</button>
		</div>

		<ul class="secondlist">
			<li><strong>Mkdir</strong> lets me create a new directory</li>
			<li>And <strong>touch newdoc.html</strong> lets me create a new file</li>
			<li>You even let me edit those files with <strong>nano filename</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<p>My favorite thing about you is that you let me have control over my computer. You take away the fluff of the OS and let me just get to work! Thanks for making my life better in every way.</p>
		<p>Love,
		<br>Kimberly Preston
