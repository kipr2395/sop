		<p>Dear GitHub,</p>

		<p>You are the true MVP amongst us beginner programmers. You let us back up our work, share our codes, and even work collaboratively. To show my appreciation, here's a few things I love about you.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>I just have to click <strong>new repository</strong> to create a repo, and you even tell me what to do next if I'm lost</li>
			<li>Then, to upload my changes, I just have to go back to my trusty terminal and say <strong>git remote add origin https://github.com/kipr2395/'reponame'</strong>, followed by <strong>git push -u origin master</strong></li>
		</ul>

		<p>I love knowing that you always have my back, especially if anything were to ever happen to my computer.</p>
		
		<p>Love,
		<br>Kimberly Preston
